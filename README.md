# Clock-App
The project I have added is an application for clients to be able to add a 12 and 24 hour clock on their websites to meet standard ISO 8601. This will allow users to be able to view a 24 hour clock as well as a 12 hour clock. 
I felt like I did well on making sure that my code was easy to read and as concise as possible, with the appropriate comments for ease of use by programmers.
I found it a bit tricky to get the asterisks in the right place, but I feel as though practice and time will help with this.
This project was interesting in that it had more of a display than some of the others I have worked on. I think this will help me be better able to incorporate symbols as necessary and create shapes within displays in the future.
I used code that was as efficient and easy to read as possible. I believe that it is simply written, with relevant comments to allow for easy maintenance, adaptability, and reading.
